**Project Name: EthFundMe**

**Function:**
EthFundMe is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate crowdfunding campaigns, fundraising activities, and similar initiatives. It allows users to deposit funds into the contract, with the creator of the contract having the ability to withdraw these funds. 

**Work Description:**
In developing EthFundMe, I integrated the PriceConverter library to enable seamless conversion between Ether (ETH) and USD. This integration enhances the user experience by providing real-time price conversion, ensuring transparency and accuracy in fund management. 

**Utilization of PriceConverter Resources:**
The PriceConverter library leverages Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface to fetch the latest ETH/USD price feed from the Sepolia Network. By accessing the latest price data, the getPrice function retrieves the current ETH price in USD, enabling accurate conversion calculations. Additionally, the getConversionRate function utilizes this price data to convert the deposited ETH amount into its equivalent value in USD. This functionality ensures that users meet the minimum funding requirement specified in USD, enhancing the integrity and usability of the EthFundMe platform. 

EthFundMe exemplifies the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing traditional fundraising methods, offering a decentralized and transparent alternative for crowdfunding initiatives.
